                Over a period of time, CMS.NET may collect personal information, including your 
                name, address, email address, birth date, gender, and zip code. After providing 
                CMS.NET with any of this information, you are no longer anonymous.

                “Remember Login” checkbox, which causes a cookie to be stored on your computer.

                CMS.NET uses two types of cookies: Session and Login.
            </P>
            <P>
                Session cookies&nbsp;only remain as long as the current session and do not 
                remain on your computer. They are used to pass session information, which 
                identifies your current session without any personal information (this is done 
                by a random number).
            </P>
            <P>
                Login&nbsp;cookies store your login authentication information so that you 
                don't have to log in each time you access the site.
            </P>
            <P>
                <STRONG><EM>To&nbsp; remove the Login cookie from your computer, you simply need to log
